# Project: PEPPOL Sync

## Project Overview

This project consists of a Python script that downloads a large XML file of business cards from the PEPPOL directory, splits it into smaller XML files organized by country and month, and then commits these files to a Git repository. The process is automated to run daily via a GitHub Actions workflow. The project also uses MkDocs with the Material theme for generating documentation.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **Language:** Python 3, Go 1.23.5
*   **Libraries:** No external libraries beyond standard Python libraries are used.
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
*   **Documentation:** MkDocs

**Architecture:**

The core logic is encapsulated in the `peppol_sync.py` script. This script is designed to be run from the command line and accepts actions like `sync`, `check`, and `download`. It handles downloading the XML file, parsing it in a memory-efficient way, and writing the split XML files to the `extracts/` directory. A GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/daily.yml` automates the execution of this script and manages the Git commit/push cycle.

## Building and Running

There are no explicit build steps required for this project. The script can be run directly using Python.

**Running the script:**

*   **Sync data:** To run the main synchronization process, which includes downloading the XML file and splitting it, use the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 peppol_sync.py sync
    ```

*   **Force download:** To force a re-download of the XML file, even if it already exists, use the `--force` flag:

    ```bash
    python3 peppol_sync.py sync --force
    ```

*   **Check configuration:** To check the configuration and paths, use the `check` command:

    ```bash
    python3 peppol_sync.py check
    ```

**Running the documentation server:**

To serve the documentation locally, you can use the following MkDocs command:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The Python code follows standard PEP 8 conventions.
*   **Commit Messages:** The automated commit messages generated by the GitHub Actions workflow have the format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ < peppol_sync automated update`.
*   **Branching:** The workflow runs on the main branch, and all changes are committed directly to it.
*   **Testing:** There are no explicit tests included in the project.
